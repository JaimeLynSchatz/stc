#Dateslider
Dateslider.js is a fork of an old (2008) codeset forked from a [Google Code repository](http://code.google.com/p/dateslider/downloads/detail?name=Dateslider_v1.3.zip&can=2&q):


I am updating/rewriting it to work on modern browsers in an attempt to make a widget for use in the MediaWiki OpenStreetMaps OpenHistoricalMaps project.
